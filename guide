# Progressive Leasing — Interview Answers (Full, LaTeX‑Formatted)

## Question 1 – What does the company do?

Progressive Leasing is a financial‑technology company that enables **lease‑to‑own** purchases at partner retailers.  
* Customers acquire items (e.g., a laptop at Best Buy) immediately.  
* Progressive Leasing pays the retailer the full cash price up front.  
* The customer repays Progressive in periodic installments and may exercise an early‑buyout option.  
* The firm’s revenue comes from lease fees and early‑buyout payments, while it **assumes credit and fraud risk**.  
* Real‑time underwriting combines financial, employment, banking, device, and historical repayment data to approve or decline each lease and set the fee schedule.

## Question 2 – What data are collected from a customer leasing a laptop at Best Buy?

| Data Domain | Variables Collected | Underwriting Purpose |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Identity & Contact** | Full name, street address, date of birth, Social Security Number, mobile phone, email | Identity verification and soft credit pull |
| **Employment & Income** | Employer name, tenure, pay frequency, net paycheck amount, employment type | Measure repayment capacity & stability |
| **Banking Behavior** | Account age, average daily balance, direct‑deposit pattern, overdraft count, deposit frequency variance | Detect cash‑flow volatility & recent distress |
| **Item & Transaction** | Retailer ID, product category (laptop), cash price incl. tax, requested term length | Determine collateral value & payment schedule |
| **Fraud Signals** | Device fingerprint, IP geolocation, application time, velocity of recent applications | Detect synthetic or high‑risk behavior |

All variables feed the risk model that outputs an approval decision and lease‑fee terms.

## Question 3 – Case Study: Manual → Automatic Underwriting (200 000 Historical Rows)

1. **Objective** – build a binary classifier:  
   $$ y=\begin{cases}1 & \text{repays in full}\\ 0 & \text{defaults}\end{cases} $$
2. **Data Prep**  
   * Handle missing values (median/indicator flags)  
   * One‑hot‑encode categorical features  
   * Log‑transform highly skewed dollar amounts
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   * Debt‑to‑income ratio  
   * Months at employer  
   * Deposit frequency variability  
   * Product price × income interaction
4. **Training / Validation**  
   * Time‑based train–test split (70 % / 30 %)  
   * Baseline logistic regression → grid‑tuned XGBoost  
   * Metrics: ROC‑AUC, Precision, Recall, F1
5. **Calibration & Profit Threshold**  
   * Isotonic calibration  
   * Expected‑profit curve:  
     $$ \text{E[Profit]} = p_{\text{repay}} \cdot \text{LeaseFee} - (1-p_{\text{repay}})\cdot\text{ExpectedLoss} $$
   * Choose approval cut‑off that maximizes E[Profit] subject to portfolio‑loss limit
6. **Explainability & Fairness** – global SHAP values, demographic bias tests  
7. **Deployment** – containerized model behind a REST endpoint; monitor drift, latency, default‑rate KPI

## Question 4 – Using Statistical / ML Tools to Evaluate Customers

### 1 Define the Predictor  
* Primary target: probability of full repayment, \( P(\text{repay}=1) \).

### 2 Feature Families  
* **Financial** – debt‑to‑income ratio, net pay stability  
* **Behavioral** – overdraft frequency, cash‑flow variance  
* **Product** – item price, category, term length  

### 3 Model Line‑Up  
| Model | Why Use It |
|-------|------------|
| Logistic regression | Baseline, interpretable coefficients |
| Gradient‑boosted trees | High accuracy on tabular, non‑linear interactions |
| Survival model (Cox) | Time‑to‑default analysis |

### 4 Evaluation  
* Classification → ROC‑AUC, Precision‑Recall, confusion matrix  
* Regression → root‑mean‑squared error if predicting dollars of lifetime profit

### 5 Business Integration  
* Approval/decline by threshold on \( P(\text{repay}) \)  
* Risk‑based pricing: higher lease fee for higher predicted default risk  
* Larger upfront payment for borderline approvals

## Question 5 – Numerical Expected‑Default‑Rate Problem

**Inputs**

* Lease value \( V = \$1000 \)  
* Target return \( r = 15\% \Rightarrow \text{Revenue if repaid } R = V(1+r)=\$1150 \)  
* Progressive pays retailer \( 0.60V = \$600 \)  
* Service fee collected upfront \( S = \$50 \)  
  → Loss if default \( L = 600 - 50 = \$550 \)

**Equation**

Set expected profit \( \text{E[Profit]} \) to zero to find break‑even repayment probability \( p \):

\[
\text{E[Profit]} = p\cdot\$1150 \;-\; (1-p)\cdot\$550 = 0
\]

\[
1150p - 550 + 550p = 0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad 1700p = 550 \quad\Rightarrow\quad
\boxed{\,p = 0.3235 \approx 32.35\%\,}
\]

**Interpretation** – Under current pricing, the underwriting model must certify that the customer’s probability of full repayment is at least \( 32.35\% \). Otherwise, Progressive must either decline the lease or raise the lease fee to meet the fifteen‑percent return requirement.
