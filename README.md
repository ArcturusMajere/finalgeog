Final GEOG Project: Wildfire Status Tracker

Welcome to the repository for my final project for GEOG 593. This project focuses on tracking wildfire status using ArcGIS Experience Builder. Below you'll find information about the project, installation instructions, and resources used.

Project Overview

This project aims to provide an interactive visualization tool for understanding the status of wildfires. The goal is to present wildfire data in an accessible and informative way using ArcGIS Experience Builder. The application is built to allow users to see real-time wildfire data, including active fire perimeters, locations, and historical fire information.

Features include:

Real-time map visualization of wildfire locations.

Dynamic layers to explore wildfire status across different periods.

Mobile-friendly user experience.

Data Sources

Data from authoritative sources, including government open data portals, is used for the wildfire status. For more details on data sources and their processing, refer to the data directory in this repository.

Installation

To use or modify the wildfire tracker experience, you will need to have access to ArcGIS Online and Experience Builder. Follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/ArcturusMajere/finalgeog.git

Access ArcGIS Experience Builder and import the project files.

Ensure you have the necessary data connections set up for real-time data feeds.

Usage

Challenges & Considerations

Data Compatibility: Ensuring all data sources were properly connected and compatible with ArcGIS templates.

Mobile Responsiveness: Adjustments were made to ensure a consistent experience across devices.

Future Enhancements

Incorporate additional environmental data layers, such as weather conditions, for more comprehensive analysis.

Improve loading speeds for the mobile version of the tracker.
