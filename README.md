"Spatial Analysis and Web GIS Visualization of Urban-Rural Remote Work Migration Trends Pre/Post-COVID"

# Spatial Analysis and Web GIS Visualization of Urban-Rural Remote Work Migration Trends Post-COVID

## Overview
This project examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on remote work trends and migration between urban and rural areas in the United States. Utilizing geostatistical methods and an interactive Web GIS platform, the analysis explores temporal and spatial dynamics in wage levels, occupational sector changes, and geographic migration patterns.

The objective is to provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders addressing economic disparities and transformations in urban-rural dynamics in a post-COVID era.
