# Geostatistical Analysis and Web GIS Application for Tracking Urban-Rural Remote Work Migration Post-COVID

## Overview
This project examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on remote work trends and migration between urban and rural areas in the United States. Utilizing geostatistical methods and an interactive Web GIS platform, the analysis explores temporal and spatial dynamics in wage levels, occupational sector changes, and geographic migration patterns.

The objective is to provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders addressing economic disparities and transformations in urban-rural dynamics in a post-COVID era.

## Key Components
### 1. **Annotated Bibliography**
The [Annotated Bibliography](https://github.com/ArcturusMajere/finalgeog/blob/main/appendix%20A.pdf) offers a comprehensive review of literature related to:
- Remote work trends.
- Urban-rural migration dynamics.
- Wage disparities influenced by the pandemic.

### 2. **Jupyter Notebook**
The [Notebook](https://github.com/ArcturusMajere/finalgeog/blob/main/updated_final2.ipynb) documents the project workflow, including:
- Data collection and preprocessing.
- Temporal and spatial analysis of remote work trends.
- Visualization of urban-rural migration patterns.
- Development of the Web GIS platform.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Sources**: American Community Survey (ACS) data (2016–2022) and TIGRIS shapefiles via PyGRIS.
- **Geostatistical Analysis**: Explores wage migration and geographic shifts in remote work intensity.
- **Web GIS**: Implements an interactive platform for visualizing remote work migration, wage disparities, and sectoral transitions using distributive flow maps.
- **Visualization**: Combines static, animated, and interactive maps to display data insights effectively.
